## Description

For this project we were tasked with creating the backend for an ecommerce app using express and sequelize. This is an area I really enjoy so it was fun working through the backend and creating the routes.
The hardest part of this assignment for me was getting the relationships between the models correct everything after that was not so bad. We needed to create all the usual CRUD routes for our three models Category, Product, and Tag. In the end this was a helpful assignment to learn how to create the backend using sequelize and express.
